    <!-- User activity timeout: Maximum screen dim duration as a percentage of screen off timeout.

         This resource is similar to config_maximumScreenDimDuration but the maximum
         screen dim duration is defined as a ratio of the overall screen off timeout
         instead of as an absolute value in milliseconds.  This is useful for reducing
         the dim duration when the screen off timeout is very short.

         When computing the screen dim duration, the power manager uses the lesser
         of the effective durations expressed by config_maximumScreenDimDuration and
         config_maximumScreenDimRatio.

         This value must be between 0% and 100%.  If the value is zero, the screen will not
         dim before the device goes to sleep.
